I built this provider to answer one simple question. How hard could it be? Well turns out it's not easy but the end result here has left me with a better appreciation for the work Hashicorp has put in to Terraform, I'm still not a 100% sure how everything works but at least I'm more educated than when i started.

This provider wouldn't be possible without the amazing [client library](https://github.com/planetscale/planetscale-go) planetscale provides, i would have spent days trying to mock api requests without it.

If you found this cool pls leave a star for dopamine or consider buying me a coffee :)
